# Analysis I - MATH 554 with Dr. Ralph Howard, Supplementary with Dr. Benaida Shabani

There are a couple things here. Most of the homework is from my semester-long analysis class I took my fifth semester. However, I also took a supplementary class on linear algebra at UChicago the summer before the class, so I've included the work for that as well (with prefix C for Chicago). The classes had a lot of overlap, but with different emphasises.

Across the classes, we covered the following topics:
- Properties of fields/real numbers, least upper bound axiom
- Metric spaces and basics of topology
- Cauchy/convergent sequences, completeness
- Equivalence of sequential compactness and compactness
- Lebesgue covering lemma, Bolzanno-Weierstrass, Heine-Borel
- Connectedness, intervals in $\mathbb{R}^n$
- Continuity, Lipschitz and uniform continuity, IVT
- Limits at a point
- Integration in $\mathbb{R}^n$, Fubini's and Stokes' theorems

Having the class at UChicago before my main analysis class was super helpful for this. I got a sweeping overview in 8 weeks, and while it was challenging to keep up, my professor was great and I got the ideas of how things fit together. My analysis class after at UofSC went more slowly, so I was able to fill in the details of what had gone over my head over the summer, and make connections and understand things more deeply than I think I would have if I'd been learning it for the first time. Dr. Howard was also quite good, and I was glad I got the chance to take his Analysis II class. I came out of this class with much more of an appreciation for where calculus comes from and its foundations, and I look forward to taking more analysis in the future.
