This wasn't my favorite class. I knew a lot of the material from high school, and I feel like it was presented in a more motivated and clear way there than in this class. I was sort of disappointed since I was looking forward to learning more stats--in fairness, I hadn't seen the things we'd done with model fitting before, so that was interesting. Frankly, I felt somewhat less interested in statistics after this class than before, but maybe I'll learn some more and get into it again.
