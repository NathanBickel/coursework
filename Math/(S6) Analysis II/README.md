# Analysis II - MATH 555 with Dr. Ralph Howard

We covered the following topics:
- Derivaties, mean value theorem
- Rolle's and Taylor's theorems
- Riemann integration
- Fundamental theorem of calculus
- Defining logarithm and trig functions
- Sequences and limit superiors
- Series and tests for convergence
- Uniform converge and Dirac sequences

I generally enjoyed this class. It was a good review of the nitty gritty of calculus I had forgotten (or in some cases had never quite learned), and I think it was valuable to see proofs of all the results I've used in the past. At times it started to feel a little repetitive and I got frustrated doing some of the homework sets, but that might be somewhat inevitable. I think this class was good practice figuring out what needs to be written down formally and what can be waved away to some extennt. My inclination is try to do everything formally to the point of being annoying (this might be apparent in the earlier homework sets), but at a point in this class that became so tedious that I started glossing over things when it felt appropriate. I'm not sure if I've found the right balance or not, but I think I got closer to it. Anyway, I'm ready for a bit of a break from analysis after taking a full year of it, but I think I'll enjoy getting back into in grad school.
