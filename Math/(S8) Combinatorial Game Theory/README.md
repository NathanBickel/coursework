# MATH 576 - Combinatorial Game Theory with Dr. William Linz

We used Elwyn Berkekamp, John Conway, and Richard Guy's *Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays, Volume 1* textbook and covered the following topics:
- Impartial games such as Subtraction-S, Kayles, Nim, Dawson's chess, Chomp!, and octal games
- Sprague-Grundy theory, nimbers, and computing the nimber of an impartial game
- Partisan games such as COL, Toppling Dominoes, Domineering, and Toads-and-Frogs
- Definition and operations on numbers, equalites of games, number avoidance theorems
- Infinitesimal games, properties of left and right stops
- Switches and temperature theory of games
- Mis√®re games, games with looping, and transfinite games

One of my favorite math classes I've taken in a while. All of this material was entirely new to me, and I had a great time trying to figure things out for myself and processing the concepts both in and out of classes. Those who know me know I enjoy chess, and the natural tie-ins to that (even though chess isn't quite a combinatorial game under the assumptions we made in class) made the material even more enjoyable. Dr. Linz was a great lecturer, had a great set of notes that he posted, and gave homework problems that were just the right level of challenging. I also enjoyed the quirky textbook, and our class was a great environment (it was fairly small and we were all math majors that got along well together). I'd be interested to learn more about game theory and potentially do some game-theoretic research in the future (it seems like it dovetails nicely with graph theory).
