# Theory of Computation - MATH 562 with Dr. Stephen Fenner

For various degree requirement reasons, I ended up taking two classes with the same professor that covered much of, but not entirely, the same material. I've included things from the other class (Foundations of Computation - CSCE 355) here.

We used Michael Sipser's *Introduction to the Theory of Computation* and J.E. Hopcroft et al.'s *Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation* and covered the following topics:
- Finite automata and regular expressions
- Closure properties and nonregular languages
- Minimization and Myhill-Nerode theorem
- Context-free grammars and push-down automata
- Pumping lemmas for regular and context-free languages
- Turing machines and the Church-Turing thesis
- Decidable and undecidable problems, mapping-reductions
- P, NP, and polynomial bounded reducibility
- Cook-Levin theorem and NP-completeness
- PSPACE and PSPACE-completeness

Far and away my favorite computer science class I've taken in a long time (though I suppose it's not too surprising that I would enjoy a class cross-listed as math more). I had heard about Turing machines, decidability, and P vs. NP before, so I really enjoyed learning about these rigorously and seeing connections to other areas I'm interested in like graph theory. Dr. Fenner presented the material quite well, so I feel like I learned everything pretty solidly. I also just found the material with finite state machines fun--it felt a lot like solving puzzles. I've been thinking for a while like I don't much enjoy computer science, but this class was refreshing and made me question that assumption. I've done some reading about these topics after the class, and I'd happily learn more if it's helpful for something I'm doing.
