# Discrete Mathematics II - MATH 575 with Dr. Ruth Luo

We used Douglas West's *Introduction to Graph Theory* textbook and covered the following topics:
- History and definitions
- Handshaking lemma, graphic sequences, Havel-Hakimi theorem
- Trees, BFS and DFS, Kruskal's and Djikstra's algorithms
- Matchings, Hall's theorem, Berge-Tutte formula
- Strong and weak duality, König-Egerváry theorem
- Connectivity, Menger's theorem, max-flow min-cut
- Coloring and edge-coloring, greedy algorithm, degeneracy
- Planarity, Euler's formula, Wagner's and Kuratowski's theorems
- Hamiltonian cycles, Turán graphs, extremal graph theory
- Ramsey theory, infinite graphs

This is pretty solidly both my favorite and most challenging math class I've taken up to this point. Dr. Luo's research area is graph theory, so I loved being taught about what felt like a pretty niche topic to me by someone who was very knowledgeable and passionate about it, and I felt like I got more insight about how math research works from her talking about it. This class stretched my abilities more than they had been before, and I had to put a lot of time and thought into the homeworks, but I feel like that's the best way to learn. As of writing this about a semester after this class ended, I haven't found a topic that I've enjoyed as much as graph theory, and I'm still interested in potentially doing research in this area.
