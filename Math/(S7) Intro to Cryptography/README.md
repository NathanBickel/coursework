# Introduction to Cryptography - MATH 587 with Dr. Matthew Ballard

We used J. Hoffstein, J. Pipher, and J. Silverman *An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography* textbook and covered the following topics:
- Historical background, substitution ciphers
- Modular arithmetic, powers and primitive roots, Euclidean algorithm
- Chinese remainder theorem, Fermat's little theorem
- Public key cryptography, discrete log problem
- Diffie-Hellman key exchange, Elgamal cryptosystem
- RSA encryption
- Number theory, quadratic reciprocity, prime factorization
- Elliptic curve cryptography

Honestly, I wish I'd had more homework, because I feel like more homework would have solidified the concepts better. Overall though, this was a cool and interesting class. It was a bit more theoretical and proof-based than I was expecting given that it's cross-listed as a computer science class, which was nice. I had seen a number of the results before, but it was a good review and culmination of them. I'd be interested to do more number theory in grad school if I have time.
