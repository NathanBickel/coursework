# Vector Calculus - Math 241 with Dr. Daniel Dix

This was the first math class I took in college (I took AP calculus in high school). I remember this class somewhat fondly---the material felt somewhat familiar and a natural extension of what I had learned in high school, but I also got more of a taste for rigor and working together with classmates in college math. Sadly Dr. Dix recently passed away, but I remember him explaining things (particularly the big culmination at the end of the semester with Greene's and Stokes' Theroems) enthusiastically and in a way that helped me connect those ideas to ideas I'd learned in physics. This was the semester I was considering adding my math major, and I feel this class pushed me in the right direction.

Unfortunately, as all the homework was submitted through online software, this is the only class I don't have any work from.

We used Thomas's Calculus textbook, and covered the following topics:
- Vector algebra, geometry of three-dimensional space
- Lines, curves, planes and surfaces in space
- Partial differentiation, gradients, max-min theory
- Polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinate systems
- Multiple and iterated integration
- Line integrals, vector fields, surface integrals
- Greenâ€™s theorem in 2D, and Gauss and Stokes theorem in 3D
