# Discrete Mathematics I - MATH 574 with Dr. Ruth Luo

We used Kenneth Rosen's *Discrete Mathematics and its Applications* textbook, and covered the following topics:
- Combinatorics and combinatorial arguments
- PHP, binomial theorem, inclusion-exclusion
- Discrete probability and distributions
- Expectation and variance properties
- Recurrence relations and generating functions
- Equivalence relations, modular arithmetic
- Intro to number theory and cryptography
- Graphs, trees, Ramsey theory

I really enjoyed this class. It was challenging since we covered so much ground, but it was cool seeing such a wide range of topics and some of the connections between them. This was the first class I took after my proofs class ended, so it felt really satisfying being able to use that new skillset to learn about a new topic rigorously and see how more advanced math used the ideas I had just learn about. Dr. Luo is also probably my favorite math professor I've had---she explained things super clearly and had high expectations for us, but also made the class environment fun and comfortable to express confusion in. I was happy I got the chance to take her Discrete II class as well.
