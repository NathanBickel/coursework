# Linear Algebra - MATH 544 with Dr. Matthew Boylan, Supplementary with Dr. Nikiforos Mimikos-Stamatopoulos and Dr. Sebastian Munoz

There are a couple things here. Most of the homework is from my semester-long linear algebra class I took my fourth semester. However, I also took a supplementary class on linear algebra at UChicago the following summer, so I've included the work for that as well (with prefix C for Chicago). The classes had a lot of overlap, but with different emphasises. I also took a linear algebra lab that introduced how to use MATLAB and do some linear algebra with it. I seem to have lost track of my work from that, but I'll add it here if I find it.

Across the classes, we covered the following topics:
- Matrix defintions and computations
- Gaussian elimination, linear systems
- Invertibility
- Vector spaces and subspaces
- Linear independence, basis, dimension
- Linear transformations
- Determinants, eigenvalues, eigenvectors
- Permuations
- Orthogonality
- MATLAB

I feel like I maybe should have taken this a bit earlier---it's so important and came up in other classes before I understand what was going on, and I wish I'd had more semesters to internalize the concepts. But I enjoyed this class. Dr. Boylan was great, and it felt like a lot of things I vaguely understood all clicked into place. I think maybe I'll appreciate the content more once I use it more in other classes or research, but this was a cool introduction and the connections between ideas were satisfying. I think taking the supplementary class after was also helpful, though I don't feel I learned too much extra from it.
