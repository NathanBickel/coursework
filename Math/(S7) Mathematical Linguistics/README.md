# SCHC 501 - Mathematical Linguistics

We used Barbara Partee, Alice Meulen, and Robert Wall's *Mathematical Methods in Linguistics* textbook and covered the following topics:
- Set theory, relations, infinites
- Propositional and predicate logic
- Compositionality, lambda-abstraction
- Generalized quantifiers
- Intensionality
- Languages, grammars, automata
- Grice's maxims of conversation
- Thematic proto-roles, aspectual class
- Language and syntactic processing

This was a super interesting and fun class. It was a nice review of logic in a quite rigorous way (and interesting to see how students with a humanities background picked it up), and it was fascinating to see the concepts I've learned throughout my math undergrad be applied to language, an area which I've thought a lot about but in a different context. This class will definitely change the way I view language and communication. It was also a small nine-person seminar class, so it was an enjoyable atmosphere. One of the highlights of this semester.
