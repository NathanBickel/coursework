# Transition to Advanced Mathematics - MATH 300 with Dr. Ã‰va Czabarka

This is the first class I tried using TeX in. Unfortunately I didn't write down the questions and don't have access to them anymore, but for every other class I have the questions written down. I've included my homework for this class for completeness, though many solutions may not make sense without the questions.

We covered the following topics:
- Propositional and first-order logic
- Proof writing framework and strategies
- Introduction to set theory
- Relations and equivalence relations
- Functions and bijections
- Induction and strong induction
- Sequences and series
- Unions/intersections of indexed sets

I look back on this class as the moment when my perspective on math completely shifted. I had vague notions before this semester about logical equivalence, sets, and functions, but having everything laid out, systematically, one step at a time, purely using the definitions was so satisfying. It felt like the ideas I'd known for the last few years were finally clicking into place. This wasn't the class I've the most from, but I do think it was the class with the content I learned the best and most deeply. Every few weeks I think about something that reminds me of the class and I'll smile. I think this is when I knew for sure that I wanted to pursue math further.
