# Graduate Algebra I - MATH 701 with Dr. Wei-lun Tsai

Note that while Set 7 and Set 8 are marked "exams", they were take-home and collaborative (and problems simply taken from the textbook), so I don't see there being academic integrity violations.

We used David Dummit and Richard Foote's *Abstract Algebra* textbook and covered the following topics:
- Binary operations and group/ring/field definitions
- Dihedral, symmetric, matrix, and quaternion groups
- Homomorphisms, isomorphisms, normal subgroups, and quotient groups
- Group isomorphism theorems
- Composition series, the HÃ¶lder program, solvable groups
- Group actions, the class equation, Sylow theorems
- Direct products and semidirect products
- Subrings, ideals, and ring isomorphism theorems

I definitely learned a lot in this class. The difficulty jump from the undergraduate to graduate level was a bit intimidating, but I enjoyed thinking through the tougher problems and doing my best to internalize the concepts I learned. Unfortunately, I bit off more than I could chew this semester in terms of workload and wasn't quite able to give this class the time I needed to fully understand everything. However, my interest in algebra has definitely been peaked, and I'm excited to have a solid basis for understanding when I take algebra in grad school.
