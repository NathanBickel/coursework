# Algebraic Structures I - MATH 546 with Dr. Adela Vraciu

We used Beachy and Blair's *Abstract Algebra* textbook, and covered the following topics:
- Congruence classes and integer groups
- Group definitions, examples, properties
- Subgroup definition, subgroup verification
- Order of elements, cyclic groups
- Lagrange's theorem and corollaries
- Permutations groups, symmetries, dihedral group
- Homomorphism/isomorphism definitions, examples, properties
- Cayley's theorem
- Cosets, normal subgroups, factor groups

This class was fine. I feel like I learned the material that was presented and have a decent sense for how things fit together, but the way things were presented felt a little dry and unmotivated. Dr. Vraciu is definitely very knowledgable, and she was being very careful that all students understood what was going on, but I think that sometimes took priority over making connections between topics or giving intuition for things. I'm excited to take the second semester of algebra (which will be in a smaller class size, which will be nice) to learn more about the field.
