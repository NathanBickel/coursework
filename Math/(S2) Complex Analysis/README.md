# Applied Complex Variables - Math 552 with Dr. Matt Miller

I took this class concurrently with my class on proof-writing, so some of my proofs (especially at the beginning of the class) are a bit sketchy.

We used Brown and Churchill's *Complex Variables and Applications* textbook and covered the following topics:
- Properties of complex numbers, standard/exponential form
- Complex plane and analytic functions, differentiability
- Elementary functions, hyperbolic trigonometry
- Integration, paramaterization, contour integrals
- Antidifferentiation, Cauchy-Goursat Theorem
- Residues, poles, zeros of analytic functions
- Sequences and series

Looking back, I wish I had taken this later in my math progression. I think part of me knew it wasn't the best idea, but it sounded interesting and another part of me liked the idea of doing a class that was a stretch for my abilities. I was expecting a sort of computational calculus for complex numbers, but it ended up being a lot of analysis that I would have had more context for after taking a real analysis class. I also just wasn't used to the style of more advanced math classes---it was interesting taking this at the same time as my proof-writing class, since I was seeing examples of how those techniques were used and got to practice them in another context. At some point soon, I'd like to do a comprehensive review of this material, since I'm sure it'll make more sense since I know some real analysis now.
