We used James Kurose and Keith Ross's *Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach* and covered the following topics:
- Overview of the layered network architecture
- Network programming interfaces, such as sockets
- Transport and data link protocols
- Physical media and local area networks
- Network layer and routing/forwarding protocols
- Link layer and ARP protocol

I actually enjoyed this class a fair amount. It took me a bit to sync up with Dr. Nelakuditi (I was just reading the textbook before then), but he explained things well and the material was interesting. I don't anticipate using it in my career, but it was fun learning a bit about how the internet actually works (I didn't have much of an idea at all before this class).
