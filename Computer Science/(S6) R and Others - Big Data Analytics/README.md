# Big Data Analytics - CSCE 587 with Dr. John Rose

We covered the following topics:
- Introduction to R
- K-means clustering
- Linear and logistic regression
- Association rules
- Decision trees
- Bayes and Naive Bayes
- Hadoop, HDFS, NFS
- MapReduce, Pig, SQL, and HiveQL

I didn't really enjoy this class. In my opinion, it wasn't set up particularly well to motivate learning. However, I did learn things I didn't know before about the analysis methods we covered, and it was interesting to see how to handle big datasets with Hadoop. Maybe the things I learned will be useful someday.
