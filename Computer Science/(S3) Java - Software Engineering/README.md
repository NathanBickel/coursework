# Software Engineering - CSCE 247 with Portia Plante

This class covered a number of software engineering design patterns, and then consisted of a medium-scale group project. My team designed a hub for summer camp where parents, counselors, and camp directors can share information and a schedule can be generated for each camper. The repository for the project is located at https://github.com/Kwyandt/Camp_Hub.
