# Data Structures and Algorithms - CSCE 350 with Dr. Vignesh Narayanan

We used Levitin's *Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms* textbook, and covered the following topics:
- Formal analysis measures
- Abstraction and problem-solving
- Lists, trees, and graphs
- Common algorithmic design techniques
- Time and space complexity

---

The material for this class was interesting---I learned how to write formal pesudo-code, and got a better sense of how to design effective algorithms.
