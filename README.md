# Coursework
Hello! This is an archive of sorts of the work I've done in my classes at the University of South Carolina. I'm keeping this partially as a reference and something to look back on in the future for me, but I also take time to make my work presentable, so I feel it is reflective of my abilities and what I've learned the past few years. I've also taken a bit of time to reflect on the classes I've included, which can be seen in the corresponding readmes. I've split this into my three areas of study:

- For math, my primary major, I've included most of the classes I've taken and the topics it covered, and the homework I submitted (apart from a few things I've lost track of). I've included the classes in chronological order of when I took them: S1 means I took the class in my first semester and so on. Naturally, some of the classes I took less recently will be a bit shakier on proof-writing and TeX.
- For computer science, my secondary major, I've similarly included my classes and the code I wrote for them.
- For my english minor, I've included a few papers and projects I felt happy with. This isn't as comphrensive, since much of the coursework I did for these classes won't make too much sense without the context of the class or having read what the assignments are responding to.

If you're interested, feel free to look around! I'll try to keep this relatively up-to-date until I graduate.
